Sandcastle-Auth
Sandcastle-Auth is an authentication server designed for demo, testing, and educational use. It is not intended to be used in full production environments. Instead, it shows how a Spring Boot–based JWT authentication solution might work and allows you to experiment, learn, and test in a safe sandbox. The project is dual-licensed under both the Apache License 2.0 and the MIT License, making it easy for users to pick whichever license suits their needs.

# Overview
   • Purpose: Provide a simplified Spring Boot JWT authentication service to test user logins, domains, roles.
   1. Testing authentication flows.
   2. Educational demos of JWT with Spring Boot
   3. System test situations (e.g., debugging issues on Kubernetes with a simple auth server).


# Features:
   1. Basic username/password authentication
   2. Domain-based user segregation
   3. Simple role-based access control
   4. JWT token generation & validation
   5. H2 in-memory database support (for quick demos)
   Disclaimer: This server includes example configurations and minimal security controls. Do not deploy it as-is in production. By design it is not intended for production – more robust solutions already exist

# License
